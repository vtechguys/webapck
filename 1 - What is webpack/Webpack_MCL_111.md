Server side templating it depend on backend server. Here we create a fully render html doc and send it to client. In server side templating world we send our n new page every time the request is being made for any page. 
However SPA is when we send a bare bone of html then js is loaded with it and thus runs js code on client browser assembling the page. The page is assembled using js every time  a new page is required.
